:toc:

== Description

=== TLDR
Import ETF `.xlsx`-files provided by Vanguard and receive the distribution of their shares grouped by https://www.msci.com/documents/1296102/11185224/GICS+Methodology+2020.pdf/9caadd09-790d-3d60-455b-2a1ed5d1e48c?t=1578405935658[Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)] Industries  by MSCI.

=== What Is This Tool?

This tool lets you import the positions Excel files for ETFs provided by Vanguard (see section *Aufschl√ºsselung der Positionen* e.g. of the https://www.de.vanguard/professionell/anlageprodukte/etf/aktien/9675/ftse-developed-world-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating[Vanguard FTSE Developed World ETF]). After importing, it will match the given data of the "Sektor" column against the Industries of the https://www.msci.com/documents/1296102/11185224/GICS+Methodology+2020.pdf/9caadd09-790d-3d60-455b-2a1ed5d1e48c?t=1578405935658[GICS].

== Goal
The goal is to make this tool available to get better data quality for custom excel sheets or for tools like https://www.parqet.com/[Parqet].

== How to use
. Download ETF positions excel from Vanguard (see <<Description>> for an exapmle link)
. Check out this tool via Git
. Run `yarn install` in root dir
. Place your downloaded files in `data` folder
. Change path in `index.ts` (will be removed, see <<TODO>>)
. Run `npx ts-node index.ts` in root dir

== TODO
* Extend matching by creating a mapping table (support needed)
* specify output format (possible JSON orientating on Parqet data format)
** maybe generate request and send it to specifiable API endpoint
** API Request uses nested object, JSON representation is `{id: string, share: number}` where id is the GICS number representation of the industry
* make multiple imports possible (needed?)
